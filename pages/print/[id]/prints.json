    "description": "Caswell-Massey is one of the oldest companies in the US; dating back as far as 1752. So as part of an initiative to modernize its packaging, I was tasked with creating the layout and instructions for mass-print production. Labeling layout and display for print production of a new line of perfumery oils sold by Caswell-Massey.",
    "process": "After relieving the logo design from our senior freelancer, I created a mark-up for our venders to print. As the in-house designer, I coordinated the spot printing for our labels. The challenging piece, however, was to quality-control the intricate points of the design, since our out-of-house print shop was unable to create accurate shine/raised emboss marks.",
    "result": "The new Essential Oils perfumery set was a start to our brand gaining footing among popular, younger companies. Combined with its social media campaigns and online advertising, the product became the introduction for both new and returning customers."

    "description": "FH Group Int'l is a car accessory company with its consumer experience based entirely online. As part of an effort to catch up to our competitors in visual direction, I created individualized 'brand voice' for our new lines of items. Targeting customers that had weaker orders (20-35-year-olds and young families) compared to other groups, we focused on design styles that were also similar to common lifestyle brands.",
    "process": "Upon researching commonly purchased brands among the target group, I compared visual cues from popular brands from Birchbox to Starbucks for their flexibility in style and wide consumer-target range. After creating several mock-ups, I narrowed down the selections based on the art director's decision to keep our visual direction tailored to each product.",
    "result": "After listing the new products on our website and platforms (Amazon, Walmart), the product was effective in hitting our goal to raise our sales among our target audience."

    "description": "FH Group Int'l is a car accessory company with its consumer experience based entirely online. In 2017, we had a slew of new products, with the Varsity covers being one the first.",
    "process": "As part of the company’s goal to expand on its customer-base, I create the visual theme based on the features for each new product. This cover was created in order to target families with children who are active in sports; thus, the product was created with heavy padding and perforated backseats. Due to its stitching and intended use, I decided to use visual cues from 1950s varsity jackets.",
    "result": "After the product went on our online store, we hit are target sales. Since the product’s features were also improvements to products in the same target audience, the covers overall were a huge boost to our reputation for creating high-quality car accessories."
