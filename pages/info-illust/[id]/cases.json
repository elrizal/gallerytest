    "description":"In 2017, FH launched a product line including new product types, in order to target our reach to customers seeking higher quality chairs and a willingess to spend more than the average cover. As an assistant to the creative director, I created the design direction and overall packaging of the line.",
    "reason":"Previously, our other products lacked the brand voice and communication of our competitors. While our goal was to convey utility above else, we noticed out competition's approach to creative direction all overlapped one another. Our creative director decided to thus make each of of our covers have their individual branding akin to say, Bath and Body Works or food brands. ",
    "process":"Given my CD's decision, I was tasked with creating the visual concept. Since our target demographic typically feel in the age ranges from 18-30-years-old, I compared our out-dated packaging of older products to brands contain similar consumers. Since our customers have purchased our products from major retailers like WalMart, I considered that the darker palletes from our competitors would go overlooked because of its design cliche in our industry. Therefore, I opted to create a design for our product that would not just convey its features, but visually stand out, as well.",

    "description":"An illustration demonstrating the materials for manufacturing one of our products from the 'lux series' in 2017.",
    "reason":"The drawing was created in order to send for manufacturing and patent agreements. Due to similar products in our competition, we aimed to create features that others did not include (anti-slip silicone backings, hidden buckts etc.).",
    "process":"I was given a rough prototype of the product. After taking photos of it for comparison to similar covers, I decided to include up-close details of the materials behind the covers. The biggest challenge, however, was documenting every edge and display of the product through drawing. This required frequent updates with our manufacutring in order to gain their expectations and clarity on the 'look and feel' that each lining of the cover.",
    "result":"This projects was the first of its kind at the company; previously, communication between the product designers and manufacturers were purely in writing. "
